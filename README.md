## Lucy in the Sky, Close to the Metal: Systems Programming for Frontend Developers

The complexity of client-side JavaScript has grown tremendously since the time of simply including a JQuery CDN link in your HTML. As developers for the web, we often focus exclusively on the network as a point of latency, however, new performance issues are being unearthed by the use of an ever larger and more diverse set of web-enabled devices. Build steps to compile, transpile, tree-shake(?!), inline, and more are becoming increasingly common - primarily due to the rapidly expanding scale at which people use modules and packages in their JavaScript. In this talk, I'll discuss my experience learning the Rust programming language and writing an operating system, IntermezzOS, and what it taught me about these useful, yet intimidating, frontend JavaScript workflows. We'll take a close look at the "abstraction tax" that we all pay in spades, and discuss the methods by which tools can help mitigate this pernicious issue. By the end of the talk, you'll be ready to engage with your current or future JavaScript build steps in a way that's CLOSER TO THE METAL.
